# Overview

This project is a **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) desktop application** designed to manage clients and system users.

The system allows users to store client information and control access to different parts of the application through user permissions.

The project was built **entirely by me from start to finish**, including:

* Database design
* Application architecture
* Business logic implementation
* Windows Forms user interface

The goal of this project was to practice **designing and implementing a structured desktop application using a multi-layer architecture**, while improving **backend development skills** and strengthening **problem-solving abilities when building multi-layered systems**.

---

# Architecture

The application follows a **3-Tier Architecture** to separate responsibilities between different layers.

## Presentation Layer (Windows Forms)

Handles the user interface and user interaction.

Examples include:

* Login screen
* Client management forms
* User management screens
* Basic validation before sending data to the business layer

The UI communicates with the database **only through the Business Layer**.

---

## Business Layer

Contains the core application logic.

Responsibilities include:

* Validating client data
* Managing application operations
* Handling permission checks
* Coordinating communication between UI and database

---

## Data Access Layer

Responsible for communicating with the **SQL Server database**.

Responsibilities include:

* Executing SQL queries
* Reading and writing data
* Managing database connections

This layer isolates database operations from the rest of the system.

---

# Main Features

## Login System

* User authentication
* Login validation using database records
* Permission-based access control

---

## User Management

* Add users
* Delete users
* Manage user permissions

---

## Client Management

* Add new clients
* Update client information
* Delete clients
* Search for clients
---

## Data Validation

* Basic input validation
* Prevent storing invalid data

---

# Database

The application uses a **SQL Server database**.

Main tables include:

## Clients

Stores customer information such as:

* ClientID
* ClientName
* Phone
* Email
* TotalOrders
* TotalPurchaseValue

---

## Users

Stores system users and their permissions:

* UserID
* UserName
* FullName
* Email
* Password
* Permissions

---

The database schema and sample data are included in:

```
Database/CRMproject.sql
```

Running this script will automatically create:

* The database
* All required tables
* Sample data for testing

---

# Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET Framework
* Windows Forms
* SQL Server
* ADO.NET
* 3-Tier Architecture

---

# Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple modules that separate UI forms, business logic, data access, settings, and database scripts.

This structure reflects the project’s modular organization, where each form or functional area is separated into its own project or folder, while business logic and data access are isolated in dedicated layers.
